libmeteopl
==========

Library for parsing weather forecast images from meteo.pl website.

Library is written in **C#** and is automatically translated to **Java** using .NET Compiler Platform ("Roslyn"). Looking for C#/Web developer to prepare C# to **Javascript** transformation class.

**Warning! This lib is currently a PoC and work-in-progress, image parser coverage is at minimal level.**

Sample input
============

  * all categories **TBD**

* Section 3 - atmospheric pressure
  * Pressure in hPa
  * Pressure in mm Hg

How to use
==========

Be warned - work in progress, no nice environment for using this library yet.

C# code was edited using Visual Studio 14 CTP, project/workspace files are provided. If you are going to use earlier version, first manage to have Roslyn working.

Java code sample was edited using IntelliJ Idea 14, project/workspace files are provided.

Changelog
=========

Versioning not really started, waiting until data category coverage grow substantially.
